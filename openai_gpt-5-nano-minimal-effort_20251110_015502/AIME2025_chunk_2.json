So |A| = 5 \u00d7 3 = 15.\n\nStep 2: Condition for a subset B of A to have lcm(B) = 2025 = 3^4 \u00d7 5^2.\n- For prime 3: the maximum exponent among elements in B must be 4. Since a ranges 0..4, at least one element in B must have a = 4, and no element can contribute an exponent >4 (impossible). So B must contain at least one divisor with a=4, and can contain any elements with a \u2264 4.\n- For prime 5: similarly, the maximum exponent among elements in B must be 2. So B must contain at least one element with b=2, and may contain any elements with b \u2264 2.\n\nThus B must include at least one element from the set A4 = {3^4 5^b : b=0,1,2} (three elements) and at least one element from the set A5 = {3^a 5^2 : a=0,1,2,3,4} (five elements). However, the same element could satisfy both requirements if it lies in the intersection A4\u2229A5, which is the single element with a=4 and b=2, namely 3^4\u00b75^2 = 2025 itself.\n\nStep 3: Use inclusion via counting subsets that include required elements.\nLet S be the full set A of 15 divisors.\n\n- Number of subsets B that include at least one from A4 and at least one from A5.\nLet X be the event \"B contains no element from A4\" and Y be \"B contains no element from A5\".\nWe want total subsets excluding those that violate either condition, and excluding the empty set later.\n\nTotal subsets of A: 2^15.\nSubsets with no A4-elements: treat A4 has 3 elements; removing them leaves 12 elements, so 2^12 subsets.\nSubsets with no A5-elements: A5 has 5 elements; removing them leaves 10 elements, so 2^10 subsets.\nSubsets with neither A4 nor A5: remove union; A4\u222aA5 has 3+5\u22121 = 7 elements (they intersect at 2025), so remaining 8 elements, giving 2^8 subsets.\n\nBy inclusion-exclusion, number of subsets B (including possibly empty) that have at least one from A4 and at least one from A5 is:\nN_all = 2^15 \u2212 2^12 \u2212 2^10 + 2^8.\n\nAdditionally, B must be nonempty. Our N_all already requires at least one from A4 and at least one from A5, so B is necessarily nonempty, so no further exclusion needed.\n\nStep 4: Compute N_all and probability.\nCompute powers:\n2^15 = 32768\n2^12 = 4096\n2^10 = 1024\n2^8 = 256\n\nN_all = 32768 \u2212 4096 \u2212 1024 + 256\nFirst 32768 \u2212 4096 = 28672\nThen 28672 \u2212 1024 = 27648\nThen +256 = 27904\n\nTotal number of subsets of A is 2^15 = 32768, but we already used that in numerator.\n\nProbability = 27904 / 32768. Simplify by gcd. Both divisible by 256? 32768/256 = 128; 27904/256 = 109? 256*109 = 27904 indeed. So reduces to 109 / 128.\n\nThus m/n = 109/128 in lowest terms (109 is prime). m+n = 109 + 128 = 237.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{237}.", "ground_truth": 237, "score": {"correct": true, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": true}]}, "latency_seconds": 0.0133}, {"sample_id": 21, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\nThe answer is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive.\n\nCircle $\\omega_1$ with radius $6$ centered at point $A$ is internally tangent at point $B$ to circle $\\omega_2$ with radius $15$.

For example, to get $42$ cents, Silas will choose a $25$-cent coin, then a $10$-cent coin, then $7$ $1$-cent coins.
