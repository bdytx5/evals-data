Kinetically, in acidic solutions, oxygen reacts more slowly with many substrates because the overall reaction pathways can become diffusion- or proton-transfer-limited, but the key pairing for this question is \"weaker oxidant thermodynamically\" and \"slower\" for kinetics in acidic conditions.", "ground_truth": "C", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 2.1738}, {"sample_id": 23, "input": "What is the correct answer to this question: In an experiment, a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide.
