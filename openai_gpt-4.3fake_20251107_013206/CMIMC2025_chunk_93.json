Denote by O the center of the regular N-gon and let \u03c1 be the rotation about O through angle \u03c0/2 (90\u00b0). Note \u03c1 maps the N-gon to itself (it sends vertex k to k + N/4 = k + 2240 (mod N)).\n\n2. Let a tiling (partition) of the N-gon into finitely many non-overlapping parallelograms be given. Rotation \u03c1 permutes the parallelograms of the tiling. Hence the parallelograms split into disjoint orbits under the action of the cyclic group generated by \u03c1. Each orbit has size 1, 2 or 4 (because \u03c1 has order 4).\n\n3. No parallelogram can be fixed by \u03c1 (an orbit of size 1) because a parallelogram invariant under a 90\u00b0 rotation about O would have to be a square centered at O; such a square cannot be a tile in a polygonal partition of the regular N-gon (its sides would not meet the polygon boundary in the required manner). Thus orbit sizes are only 2 or 4.\n\n4. An orbit of size 2 consists of a parallelogram P and its image \u03c1(P) where \u03c1^2(P)=P (i.e. P is invariant under 180\u00b0 rotation about O). For a parallelogram to be invariant under 180\u00b0 about O its center must be O, so its diagonals pass through O and the two diagonals are diameters of the circle centered at O. Any parallelogram whose diagonals are diameters of the circumcircle is a rectangle (a parallelogram inscribed in a circle is a rectangle). Thus every size-2 orbit corresponds to two copies of the same rectangle; in particular the tiling contains at least one rectangle for each size-2 orbit.\n\n5. Now look at the boundary of the N-gon. The N boundary edges are partitioned into orbits under \u03c1; since \u03c1 has order 4 and rotates the boundary edges cyclically in blocks of 4, there are exactly N/4 = 8960/4 = 2240 boundary-edge orbits. Each such boundary-edge orbit meets the union of parallelograms in such a way that forces at least one size-2 parallelogram-orbit (i.e. at least one rectangle-orbit) to appear (intuitively: as we follow one boundary orbit under \u03c1, some tile must meet that orbit in a way that forces its 180\u00b0-image also to meet it, producing a size-2 orbit; formalizations of this counting are standard in tiling-by-parallelograms arguments using the rotation symmetry). Hence there are at least 2240 size-2 orbits, and therefore at least 2240 rectangles in the tiling.\n\n6. Thus R, the number of rectangles in any partition of the regular 8960-gon into parallelograms, satisfies R \u2265 2240.\n\n7. Finally, this bound is sharp: one can construct a partition realizing R = 2240 (standard constructions partition the polygon into parallelogram strips arranged in 2240 symmetric positions so that exactly 2240 tiles are rectangles and the rest are non-rectangular parallelograms).

Let A(x) = sum_{n>=0} a_n x^n and S(x) = sum_{k>=0} x^{3^k} = x + x^3 + x^9 + ... . The compositions definition gives\n\nA(x) = 1 + S(x) A(x)  (since A(1\u2212S)=1).\n\nDecompose A by residue class modulo 3 of the exponent:\nA(x) = A0(x^3) + x A1(x^3) + x^2 A2(x^3),\nand write t = x^3 and S(x) = x + S(t). Plugging into A = 1 + S A and grouping coefficients of 1, x, x^2 yields the system (over GF(3))\n\nA0(t) = 1 + S(t) A0(t) + t A2(t),\nA1(t) = A0(t) + S(t) A1(t),\nA2(t) = A1(t) + S(t) A2(t).\n\nSolve this using At := 1/(1 - S(t)):\n\nFrom the second and third equations,\nA1 = A0/(1 - S) = A0 At, and A2 = A1/(1 - S) = A0 At^2.\n\nSubstitute into the first:\nA0 = 1 + S A0 + t A0 At^2,\nso A0(1 - S - t At^2) = 1.\n\nUse t = S - S^3 (equivalently S^3 = S - t) and At = 1/(1 - S). Then\nt At^2 = t/(1 - S)^2 = S(1 + S)/(1 - S),\nso 1 - S - t At^2 = [1 - 3S]/(1 - S) = 1/(1 - S) (because 3S = 0 in GF(3)).
