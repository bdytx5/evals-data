As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products?\nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nChoices:\n(A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n(B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\n(C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n(D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\n\nFormat your response as follows: \"The correct answer is (insert answer here)\"", "output": "I need to analyze the epistatic relationships and interactions between these genes based on the resistance data.\n\nLet me examine the key observations:\n\n**Single mutants:**\n- g1: 75% (mild effect)\n- g2: 0% (severe effect - complete loss of resistance)\n- g3: 50% (moderate effect)\n\n**Double mutants:**\n- g1g2: 0% (same as g2 alone)\n- g1g3: 10% (much worse than either single mutant)\n- g2g3: 0% (same as g2 alone)\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n\n1. **g2g3 = g2 alone (0%)**: When g2 is knocked out, adding g3 knockout doesn't make it worse.
