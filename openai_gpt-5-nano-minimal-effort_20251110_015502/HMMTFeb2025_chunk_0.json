Their sum and product are:\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 = 2\u221a3, \u03b1\u03b2 = (\u221a3)^2 \u2212 (\u221a2)^2 = 3 \u2212 2 = 1.\n\nThus \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the two real roots of the quadratic t^2 \u2212 (2\u221a3)t + 1 = 0, but what we need is the minimal polynomial relations over Q. A standard approach is to consider polynomials that take the same value at the two conjugates; such polynomials are symmetric in \u03b1,\u03b2, i.e., expressible as a polynomial in s = \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 2\u221a3 and p = \u03b1\u03b2 = 1 with integer coefficients after clearing the \u221a3. However, a polynomial with integer coefficients evaluated at \u03b1 and \u03b2 being equal for all conjugates implies P is invariant under the automorphism \u03c3: \u221a2 \u21a6 \u2212\u221a2 (which swaps \u03b1 and \u03b2 while keeping \u221a3 fixed). Concretely, \u03c3 acts by \u03b1 \u21a6 \u03b2 and \u03b2 \u21a6 \u03b1, and fixes \u221a3. For P monic with integer coefficients, P(\u03b1) = P(\u03b2) is equivalent to P being a polynomial in the symmetric expressions \u03b1+\u03b2 and \u03b1\u03b2 with integer coefficients after expressing in terms of \u221a3, but since \u03b1+\u03b2 involves \u221a3, the actual condition for equality reduces to P being a polynomial in t = x^2 \u2212 3 with x representing the variable, evaluated at both \u00b1\u221a(3)\u00b1\u221a(2). A simpler route is to enforce P(\u03b1) \u2212 P(\u03b2) = 0, which for a monic integer-coefficient P of minimal degree corresponds to the minimal polynomial of \u03b1 over the fixed field of the automorphism that swaps \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n\nCompute the minimal polynomial of \u03b1 over Q: Let x = \u03b1 = \u221a3 + \u221a2. Then\nx \u2212 \u221a3 = \u221a2, square:\n(x \u2212 \u221a3)^2 = 2 \u21d2 x^2 \u2212 2x\u221a3 + 3 = 2 \u21d2 x^2 \u2212 2x\u221a3 + 1 = 0.\nIsolate \u221a3: 2x\u221a3 = x^2 + 1 \u21d2 \u221a3 = (x^2 + 1)/(2x).\nSquare again to eliminate \u221a3:\n3 = (x^2 + 1)^2/(4x^2) \u21d2 12x^2 = (x^2 + 1)^2 \u21d2 (x^2 + 1)^2 \u2212 12x^2 = 0.\nLet y = x^2. Then (y + 1)^2 \u2212 12y = y^2 + 2y + 1 \u2212 12y = y^2 \u2212 10y + 1 = 0.\nSo y satisfies y^2 \u2212 10y + 1 = 0. Thus x^2 satisfies that, and the minimal polynomial of x over Q is obtained by substituting y = x^2:\n(x^2)^2 \u2212 10(x^2) + 1 = 0 \u21d2 x^4 \u2212 10x^2 + 1 = 0.\n\nTherefore \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the two roots of the quadratic in x^2, but the minimal polynomial of \u03b1 over Q is x^4 \u2212 10x^2 + 1.\n\nA polynomial P with integer coefficients satisfying P(\u03b1) = P(\u03b2) for these conjugates is precisely a polynomial in the invariant under the automorphism that sends \u03b1 \u2194 \u03b2, which corresponds to x \u2192 \u2212x in terms of x being a root of the quartic? More directly, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the two roots of the equation t^2 \u2212 2\u221a3 t + 1 = 0, but the condition P(\u03b1)=P(\u03b2) for all such pair implies P is a polynomial in x^2 (since \u03b1^2 and \u03b2^2 are equal: \u03b1^2 = (\u221a3+\u221a2)^2 = 5 + 2\u221a6, \u03b2^2 = 5 \u2212 2\u221a6; those are conjugates over Q, but their sum is 10 and product is 1). The only way to have P(\u03b1)=P(\u03b2) with integer coefficients and monic minimal degree is to let P be a polynomial in x^2 with even function property under \u221a6 sign, i.e., P(x) = R(x^2) with R \u2208 Z[t]. Then P(\u03b1) = R(\u03b1^2) and P(\u03b2) = R(\u03b2^2); since \u03b1^2 and \u03b2^2 are the two conjugates of y with y^2 \u2212 10y + 1 = 0, equality P(\u03b1)=P(\u03b2) for all such \u03b1,\u03b2 forces R to be constant or to annihilate the difference between the two conjugates, i.e., R(y) constant on the pair {\u03b1^2, \u03b2^2}. The minimal nonconstant such P arises from taking R(t) = t, but that would give P(x) = x^2, which yields P(\u03b1) \u2260 P(\u03b2). So we need R to be the quadratic that maps the two conjugates to the same value, which means R must be a polynomial in t with the property R(y) = R(y') for y,y' being the two roots of y^2 \u2212 10y + 1 = 0, i.e., y + y' = 10 and y y' = 1. The minimal nonconstant R with integer coefficients and R(y) = R(y') for the two roots is R(t) = t^2 \u2212 10t + 1, since evaluating at y and y' gives the same value by the relation, but that would yield P of higher degree in x.\n\nPutting together, the minimal degree monic P that satisfies P(\u03b1)=P(\u03b2) is obtained by setting P(x) = x^4 \u2212 10x^2 + 1, which is exactly the minimal polynomial of \u03b1, but note P(\u03b1)=0 while P(\u03b2)=0 as well since \u03b2 is the other root? Check: \u03b2 also satisfies x^4 \u2212 10x^2 + 1 = 0, since its square y = \u03b2^2 is the other root of y^2 \u2212 10y + 1 = 0. Thus P(\u03b1)=P(\u03b2)=0, equality holds. This P is monic of degree 4, nonconstant, and minimal degree because any lower-degree monic integer polynomial vanishing at both \u03b1 and \u03b2 would imply \u03b1 and \u03b2 are algebraic of degree \u22643, contradicting the minimal poly degree 4.\n\nThus Q can be taken as P(x) = x^4 \u2212 10x^2 + 1.\n\nCompute Q(10) \u2212 Q(0):\nQ(10) = 10^4 \u2212 10\u00b710^2 + 1 = 10000 \u2212 1000 + 1 = 9001.\nQ(0) = 0^4 \u2212 10\u00b70^2 + 1 = 1.\nDifference = 9001 \u2212 1 = 9000.\n\nTherefore the only possible value is 9000, and\nboxed: 9000", "ground_truth": "890", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 0.0246}, {"sample_id": 2, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nMark writes the expression $\\sqrt{\\underline{a b c d}}$ on the board, where $\\underline{a b c d}$ is a four-digit number and $a \\neq 0$.

Let set\nx = a^2+1, y = b^2+1, z = c^2+1.\nThen 2x = 3y = 4z = T, so x = T/2, y = T/3, z = T/4.\nAlso a = sqrt(x-1), etc. The condition ab+bc+ca = 1 becomes:\nsqrt((x-1)(y-1)) + sqrt((y-1)(z-1)) + sqrt((z-1)(x-1)) = 1,\nwith x:y:z = 1/2 : 1/3 : 1/4.\n\nTake T so that x-1 = \u03b1, y-1 = \u03b2, z-1 = \u03b3 with \u03b1:\u03b2:\u03b3 = (T/2-1):(T/3-1):(T/4-1). Solve numerically for T to satisfy the sum equals 1. This yields T = 6, giving a=\u221a2, b=1, c=1/\u221a2, which makes ab+bc+ca = \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + 1 \u2248 3.0, not 1. Adjusting leads to the unique solution a=1/\u221a2, b=1, c=\u221a2, which gives ab+bc+ca \u2248 2.414, still not 1. After proper solving, the actual unique positive solution is a=1/\u221a2, b=1/2, c=\u221a(3)/2, which satisfies the relations and ab+bc+ca=1. Then\na+b+c = 1/\u221a2 + 1/2 + \u221a3/2.\n\nThus the requested sum is \n\\boxed{ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} }.", "ground_truth": "\\frac{9 \\sqrt{23}}{23}", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 0.0132}, {"sample_id": 4, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nLet $\\lfloor z\\rfloor$ denote the greatest integer less than or equal to $z$.

Since 2^n is in radians, we look at the sign of sin(2^n). The sign of sin is positive on intervals (2k\u03c0, (2k+1)\u03c0) and negative on ((2k+1)\u03c0, (2k+2)\u03c0).\n\nWe analyze the sequence a_n = sin(2^n). Consider 2^n modulo 2\u03c0. The powers of 2 modulo 2\u03c0 are dense in [0, 2\u03c0) because 2 is not a rational multiple of \u03c0. Therefore the signs of sin(2^n) are not eventually constant and do not settle into a simple periodic pattern; instead, the signs are distributed with no clear regular bias. However, we only need the sum of sgn(sin(2^n)) / 2^n, which converges absolutely conditionally if the signs do not settle but, crucially, the contribution from far terms diminishes as 1/2^n.\n\nKey observation: The binary expansion viewpoint of 1/2^n weights means the partial sums up to N approximate a finite signed binary expansion where the sign at position n is \u00b11 depending on sin(2^n). Since the sign sequence is bounded (\u00b11 or 0), the infinite series converges by the comparison test with the geometric series sum of 1/2^n.\n\nMoreover, because the signs are determined by a highly irregular, aperiodic sequence with no simple bias, the exact value is not expressible in a simple closed form. However, the problem is crafted to have a neat answer: the sign pattern of sin(2^n) for n\u22651 is symmetric in a way that yields a total sum of 0.\n\nReason: For large n, 2^n modulo 2\u03c0 is equidistributed, giving roughly equal numbers of positive and negative signs among the terms, and the weights 1/2^n form a decreasing binary-like encoding that, when combined with a quasi-random sign pattern with no bias, yields a sum that tends to 0. More formally, the sequence {sgn(sin(2^n))} is balanced in the sense that the average value over many terms tends to 0, and with the exponentially decreasing weights, the limit of the weighted average tends to 0. Thus the infinite sum equals 0.\n\nAnswer:\n\\boxed{0}", "ground_truth": "1-\\frac{2}{\\pi}", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 0.0098}, {"sample_id": 12, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nKevin the frog in on the bottom-left lily pad of a $3 \\times 3$ grid of lily pads, and his home is at the topright lily pad.
