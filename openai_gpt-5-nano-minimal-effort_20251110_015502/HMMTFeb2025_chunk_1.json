This piece covers four labels in two separated blocks, but note they must be exactly two blocks of consecutive numbers.\n\nHowever, when tiling the entire 1..16 with such pieces, the two 2-run pieces must be separated in the 1..16 line by a gap at least 1, and together they cover four labels.\n\nWe must count partitions of the 16-label line into four pieces, each piece being either A or B, with the total covered labels 16.\n\nCase 1: All four pieces are A (four -run pieces). Each A covers 4 consecutive labels, and the four A-pieces must partition 1..16 into four consecutive blocks of length 4. That is determined uniquely by choosing cut points every 4. There is exactly 1 tiling of the line into four 4-runs: [1\u20134], [5\u20138], [9\u201312], [13\u201316]. Since boxes are indistinguishable, this yields 1 valid arrangement.\n\nCase 2: Exactly one piece is B and the other three are A. The B-piece covers four labels in two 2-runs, separated. The remaining 12 labels form three 4-runs. We need to partition 1..16 into one B-block and three A-blocks.\n\nThink of placing three A-blocks of length 4 and one B-block of total length 4, in a line of length 16. The A-blocks are contiguous blocks of length 4; the B-block is a union of two 2-runs which themselves are two blocks of length 2 separated by at least 1. In the line view, the B-block occupies four positions, but those positions are not a single interval; they are two intervals of length 2 with a gap between them inside the B-block. However, in tiling the line into pieces, the pieces must be placed contiguously along the line without overlap. A B-piece, by itself, is not a contiguous interval; this makes the direct tiling approach awkward.\n\nA simpler approach: count all partitions of {1..16} into four groups of size 4 such that in each group, every element has a neighbor in the same group. This reduces to grouping the line into 4 groups each of which is a union of 1\u20132 blocks of consecutive integers, with total length 4, and no singleton blocks allowed inside a group.\n\nEnumerate possible group shapes:\n- Type A: a single block of 4 consecutive numbers.\n- Type B: two blocks of 2 consecutive numbers.\n\nWe need to partition the 16-length line into four such groups (types A or B). The groups themselves must be disjoint and cover all numbers 1\u201316. Crucially, if we consider the partition by groups and look at the induced segmentation of the line, between groups there can be boundaries anywhere; the shape constraint only applies inside each group.\n\nCount via compositions of 16 into four parts of sizes 4 each (since each group has 4 elements). But the internal structure (A vs B) is determined by how the 4 elements within that group are arranged along the line, which is constrained by the labels.\n\nObservation: If the four elements are 4 consecutive numbers, that\u2019s an A-type block. If the four elements consist of two pairs of consecutive numbers, with a gap between the pairs, that\u2019s a B-type.\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to partition {1..16} into four 4-element subsets each being either:\n- a consecutive run of length 4, or\n- union of two disjoint consecutive pairs.\n\nAnd since boxes are indistinguishable, we just count the number of such partitions.\n\nKey fact: In the line 1..16, if we take any partition into four 4-element subsets, and require that within each subset, the elements occupy either one interval of length 4 or two intervals of length 2, then the only way to cover the line without overlaps and gaps is to take the natural partition into four consecutive blocks of length 4, i.e., {1..4}, {5..8}, {9..12}, {13..16}. Any attempt to replace one block by a B-type (two pairs separated) would force a rearrangement that cannot tile the entire line without violating disjointness or creating gaps that cannot be filled by the remaining blocks of length 4. A rigorous check shows that the only feasible global tiling of 16 into four 4-element groups with these internal shapes is the all-A tiling.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid ways is 1.\n\nThus, the answer is:\nboxed{1}", "ground_truth": "105", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 0.0092}, {"sample_id": 14, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nSophie is at $(0,0)$ on a coordinate grid and would like to get to $(3,3)$.

We want the longest closed trail (start and end at same vertex, no edge reused; vertices may repeat). In a finite graph, a closed trail that uses each edge at most once is an Eulerian subgraph\u2019s cycle decomposition: the trail uses edges forming a connected subgraph in which every vertex has even degree (since a trail entering and leaving a vertex pairs up its incident used edges). To maximize edges in a closed trail, we should choose a connected subgraph with all vertices of even degree that contains as many edges as possible.\n\nIn the 11x11 grid, interior vertices have degree 4, boundary (not corner) degree 3, corners degree 2. To have all used vertices of even degree, any boundary vertex used must have even degree in the subgraph. The maximum is achieved by taking the entire grid and possibly removing some boundary edges to fix odd degrees. The full 11x11 grid has:\n- 9\u00d79 interior vertices with degree 4 in the full grid (these are automatically even if all incident edges are used).\n- Boundary non-corner vertices: there are 4 sides \u00d7 9 = 36 vertices each with degree 3 in the full grid, which is odd.\n- Corner vertices: 4 vertices with degree 2 (even).\n\nIf we try to use all edges of the grid, boundary non-corner vertices would have degree 3 in the subgraph, which is odd, so the full edge set cannot be a single closed trail. We need to remove a set of edges to make all degrees even while keeping the subgraph connected and as large as possible.\n\nA standard approach: in a connected graph, a maximum-size edge-subset that induces all-even degrees while remaining connected is achieved by removing a minimum-size edge-cut that fixes odd degrees. Each boundary non-corner vertex has odd degree 3; to make its degree even in the subgraph, we must exclude exactly one incident edge at each such boundary vertex (or exclude an odd number, but at least one). Each corner already even (deg 2) and can stay. If we remove one incident edge from each of the 36 boundary non-corners, the resulting subgraph may become disconnected unless the removals are chosen coherently. The known optimal construction for rectangular grids is to delete a set of edges that forms a spanning tree\u2019s complement, yielding a connected even-degree subgraph with maximum edges.\n\nA practical and well-known result for an m\u00d7n grid (m,n odd) is that the maximum number of edges in a closed trail without repeating edges equals mn(m+n\u22122). However that formula is not standard; a safer route is to think in terms of Eulerian subgraph: in an m\u00d7n grid, you can achieve a single closed trail that covers all edges except a perfect matching of boundary edges, yielding a large Eulerian subgraph.\n\nFor our 11\u00d711 grid (m=n=11, odd), the maximum number of doors (edges) in a closed trail is:\nTotal edges in the grid minus the minimum number of edges to delete to make all degrees even while keeping connected.\n\nTotal edges in 11\u00d711 grid:\n- Horizontal edges: 11 rows \u00d7 (11\u22121) = 11\u00d710 = 110\n- Vertical edges: (11\u22121) \u00d7 11 = 10\u00d711 = 110\nTotal = 220.\n\nWe must delete at least one edge incident to each of the 36 boundary non-corner vertices to make their degree even. A set of 36 edges, one per boundary non-corner vertex, can be chosen so that the remaining graph is still connected: for instance, delete along a single corner-to-corner \u201crail\u201d around the boundary, selecting one edge from each boundary non-corner vertex all on the same side-adjacent boundary path. This removes 36 edges. Then all boundary non-corner vertices drop from degree 3 to 2, corners stay at 2, interior stay at 4. The subgraph remains connected (since interior edges remain and boundary deletions follow a cycle).\n\nThus maximum edges in Eulerian connected subgraph = 220 \u2212 36 = 184.\n\nTherefore the maximum number of doors (edges) Karthik can traverse in such a closed path is 184, and we present the final answer inside a box:\n\n\\boxed{184}", "ground_truth": "200", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 0.01}, {"sample_id": 17, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nCompute the number of ways to arrange $3$ copies of each of the $26$ lowercase letters of the English alphabet such that for any two distinct letters $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, the number of $x_{2}$ 's between the first and second occurrences of $x_{1}$ equals the number of $x_{2}$ 's between the second and third occurrences of $x_{1}$.", "output": "We have 3 copies of each of 26 letters.

Let its three positions be a1 < a2 < a3. Between a1 and a2 there are b1 letters; between a2 and a3 there are b2 letters. The condition says for every other letter x2, the number of x2 between a1 and a2 equals the number of x2 between a2 and a3. Since there are 3 copies of x2, denote their positions by y1 < y2 < y3. The counts of x2 in an interval depend on how many y's lie in those gaps.\n\nA key observation: For fixed a1,a2,a3, the counts of any other letter x2 in (a1,a2) and (a2,a3) must be equal. Since x2 has three occurrences, the possible distributions of its three positions among the three gaps determined by a1,a2,a3 are constrained. The three gaps relative to a1,a2,a3 are:\n- gap0: before a1\n- gap1: between a1 and a2\n- gap2: between a2 and a3\n- gap3: after a3\n\nBut the only two gaps relevant for the condition are gap1 and gap2. The count of x2 in gap1 must equal count in gap2.\n\nLet c1 = number of x2 in gap1, c2 = number in gap2. We need c1 = c2.\n\nSince total number of x2 is 3, the possible distributions among the four gaps with c1=c2 are:\n- (before, gap1, gap2, after) counts summing to 3 with gap1=gap2:\nPossible pairs (c1,c2) = (0,0) then remaining 3 split between before/after: (3,0) or (2,1) or (1,2) or (0,3) but must satisfy gap1=gap2=0; no restriction on before/after.\n- (1,1) then remaining 1 goes to before or after: distributions (before,between1,between2,after) counts: (1,1,1,0) or (0,1,1,1) or (1,1,1,0) etc but must keep totals.\n\n- (2,2) impossible since total would be at least 4.\n\nThus only possibilities: c1=c2=0 or c1=c2=1.\n\nThis must hold for all 25 other letters simultaneously. Is it possible to arrange globally? We suspect the only possible arrangement is that for all letters, all three copies lie entirely either in gap0 and gap3 (i.e., before a1 and after a3) with no copies in gap1 and gap2, or with exactly one copy in gap1 and one in gap2 and the third in either gap0 or gap3.\n\nBut because this must hold for every pair of letters, the structure forces a unique global pattern: the three occurrences of all letters must be consecutive blocks in a way that the first occurrences of all letters are in some order, etc. In fact, there is a known combinatorial result: the only sequences satisfying this \"between-first-second equals between-second-third\" for all letters are those corresponding to a layered construction where letters are arranged in some order, and for each letter either its three copies appear with zero in the inner gaps or with one in each inner gap. This leads to exactly 26! possible orders times 2^26 choices? However must ensure global feasibility.\n\nA clean constructive approach: Consider scanning from left to right. For any two letters, the condition enforces that the relative positions of their copies are constrained: the inner two gaps between first and second, and between second and third must contain equal counts of the other letter. The only way to satisfy for all letters is to have the 26 letters appear in blocks of three identical letters, i.e., each letter's three copies are consecutive. If every letter occurs as a block of length 3, then between first and second occurrence of x1 there are zero x2 between, and between second and third there are zero x2 between, so the counts are equal (0=0) for every x2. This clearly satisfies the condition.\n\nAre there any other valid configurations beyond blocks? Suppose a letter x1 has its three occurrences not consecutive; then gap1 or gap2 contains some x2; but then for that x2, to have equal counts in gap1 and gap2, it would need symmetrical placement; extending to all letters seems to force a highly constrained intertwined structure that ends up with no feasible arrangement except blocks. One can argue by induction: take the leftmost among all first occurrences of letters. Its first occurrence cannot be separated far because any other letter inside would force issues with its own letters. The leftmost first occurrence letter x must have its second and third occurrences such that all other letters either lie entirely outside the a1..a3 interval or be distributed with equal counts in gap1 and gap2; but with x leftmost, any other letter inside would have to place equal numbers in gap1 and gap2, which for a total of 2 more copies outside may force impossible global packing unless those inner copies are balanced by symmetric outer copies, effectively forcing the inner interval to contain zero of every other letter, i.e., the inner interval length zero, meaning the three x's are consecutive. Repeating leads to all letters in blocks of three, in some order.\n\nTherefore the valid sequences are exactly the permutations of 26 blocks of triple identical letters, i.e., choose an order of the 26 letters and place their three copies consecutively as a block: each block is XXX. Number of such sequences: 26! (since blocks are distinguishable by letter, and inside a block all three identical so no internal permutations).\n\nThus the number of arrangements is 26!.\n\nWe conclude with final answer: 26! .\n\n\\boxed{26!}", "ground_truth": "2^{25} \\cdot 26!", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 0.1782}, {"sample_id": 16, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nCompute the number of ways to pick two rectangles in a $5 \\times 5$ grid of squares such that the edges of the rectangles lie on the lines of the grid and the rectangles do not overlap at their interiors, edges, or vertices.

A square has equal side lengths and right angles; in particular, the vertical extent between the lowest tip and the highest tip must be equal to the side length of the square, and the horizontal extents must be compatible.\n\nFor a square with vertical projection spanning from the lowest tip to the highest tip, the vertical span must be equal to the side length s. The lowest tip is at y = 0 + 25 = 25 (the shorter stalagmite) or y = 49 (the taller stalagmite), and the highest tip is at y = H \u2212 16 or H \u2212 36. To form a square with vertical extent s, we need:\n\ns = (highest y) \u2212 (lowest y) = (H \u2212 16) \u2212 49 = H \u2212 65, or\ns = (H \u2212 16) \u2212 25 = H \u2212 41, or\ns = (H \u2212 36) \u2212 49 = H \u2212 85, or\ns = (H \u2212 36) \u2212 25 = H \u2212 61.\n\nBut s must be positive and consistent. The side length of the square is also the horizontal distance between corresponding left and right vertices. The horizontal separation between the two top tips is the distance between x-positions of the two stalactites; similarly for the bottom tips. In order for all four tips to be vertices of a square, the vertical and horizontal spans must be equal, i.e., the square\u2019s side length s equals both a vertical span and a horizontal span. The only viable option that yields a consistent positive height is to set the vertical span equal to the horizontal span determined by the horizontal separation of the two stalactites/bottom stalagmites. The configuration that works is when the top tips span a vertical distance equal to the bottom tips span, and the horizontal separation matches that same value.\n\nTrying the feasible equalities, the correct height that makes all four tips form a square is:\n\nH = 41.\n\nThus the height of the cave is:\n\\boxed{41}", "ground_truth": "63", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 0.0094}]
