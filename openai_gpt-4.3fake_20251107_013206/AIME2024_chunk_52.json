Thus the circumcircle is\nx^2 + y^2 \u2212 9x + (\u221233/(2\u221a14)) y = 0.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 tangents at B and C, intersection D.\nThe tangent at B = (0,0) is ux + vy = 0 \u2192 \u22129x + v y = 0.\nThe tangent at C = (9,0) (linearizing as usual) gives 9x + v y = 81.\nSolving \u22129x + v y = 0 and 9x + v y = 81 yields\nD = (9/2, \u221227\u221a14/11).\n\nStep 4 \u2014 parametrize line AD and find second intersection P with the circle.\nSet v\u20d7 = D \u2212 A = (25/6, \u2212125\u221a14/33). Parametrize points on AD by A + t v\u20d7. The circle equation plugging this in is quadratic in t; since t = 0 is a root (point A), the other root t2 equals\nt2 = \u2212(linear coefficient)/(quadratic coefficient)\n= \u2212(2(x_A v_x + y_A v_y) \u2212 9 v_x + v v_y)/(v_x^2 + v_y^2).\n\nCompute the needed quantities:\nx_A v_x + y_A v_y = 25/18 \u2212 7000/99 = \u221213725/198,\nso 2(x_A v_x + y_A v_y) = \u221213725/99.\nAlso \u22129 v_x + v v_y = \u221275/2 + 125/2 = 25.\nThus the numerator = \u221213725/99 + 25 = \u221211250/99 = \u22121250/11.\n\nFor the denominator:\nv_x^2 + v_y^2 = (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2 = 105625/484.\n\nHence\nt2 = \u2212(\u22121250/11) / (105625/484) = (1250/11)\u00b7(484/105625) = 968/1859.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 compute AP.\nThe vector length |v\u20d7| = sqrt(105625/484) = 325/22, so\nAP = t2 \u00b7 |v\u20d7| = (968/1859)\u00b7(325/22) = 100/13.\n\nThus AP = 100/13, so m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{113}", "ground_truth": 113, "score": {"correct": true, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": true}]}}]
