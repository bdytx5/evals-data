A discount series like 30-10-2(1/2)% means successive discounts: first 30%, then 10% on the remaining, then 2.5% on the remaining after that. The single rate is a flat discount applied to the original price.\n\nCompute the net price after each sequence, assuming an original price of 1 (or 100). Net price = product of (1 - each discount in sequence).\n\n(a) Series: 30% then 10% then 2.5%\nNet factor = (1 - 0.30) * (1 - 0.10) * (1 - 0.025)\n= 0.70 * 0.90 * 0.975\n= 0.70 * 0.8775\n= 0.61425\n\nEquivalent single discount = 1 - 0.61425 = 0.38575 = 38.575%.\n\nCompare with single rate 25%:\nSingle discount 25% leaves factor 0.75.\n\nSince 0.61425 < 0.75, the series leaves a lower final price (greater total discount). So the series 30-10-2.5% is better than a flat 25%.\n\n(b) Series: 15% then 15% = (0.85)*(0.85)=0.7225; final discount = 1 - 0.7225 = 0.2775 = 27.75%.\n\nCompare with single rate 30%: single leaves 0.70.\n\nSince 0.7225 > 0.70, the two successive 15% discounts leave a higher final price than a flat 30% discount. Wait: final price after two 15% discounts is 0.7225, which is higher than 0.70, meaning total discount is 27.75% vs 30% flat. The flat 30% is better (larger discount).\n\nSo results:\n(a) The series 30-10-2(1/2)% is better than the single 25%.\n(b) The single rate of 30% is better than the series 15-15%.\n\nNow match to options:\n- (a) prefers the discount series 30-10-2(1/2)% over 25%: correct aligns with option J? Option J says \"The series 30-10-2% and the single rate of 30% are better\" not ours. We need a choice that says series 30-10-2(1/2)% is better than 25%. The options listed are specific pairings. The best mapping: The pair for (a) is \"the series 30-10-2(1/2)% and the single rate of 25% are better\" which is option A? A says: \"The series 30-10-2(1/2)% and the single rate of 25% are better\" Yes that matches: series better than 25% and implies both are better than others in comparison set. For (b) \"the single rate of 30% is better than the series 15-15%\" matches option J? J mentions 30% and 30% with series 30-10-2(1/2)%. Not right. Option B says \"The single rate of 25% and the series 15-15% are better\" not correct. Option F says both series are equally beneficial\u2014no. The problem asks which is better; we pick option A for (a) and option D? Option D: \"The series 25-15-2% and the single rate of 30% are better\" not our results. Option G/H/I etc. We need a single option that states the two comparisons: (a) series 30-10-2(1/2)% better than 25%; (b) single 30% better than 15-15%. None of the options present that exact combination. The closest consistent choice might be E: \"The series 30-10-2(1/2)% is better, but there is no difference between the series 15-15% and the single rate of 30%\" \u2014 but this is incorrect since 15-15% is worse than 30%.\n\nGiven the computed results, the correct statements are:\n- (a) 30-10-2(1/2)% is better than 25%.\n- (b) 30% single is better than 15-15%.\n\nNo provided option exactly matches both. If forced to pick the option that reflects (a) and (b) individually, none do. The closest single-choice that reflects the first part is A, but it also asserts both are better (ambiguous).
