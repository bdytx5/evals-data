The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.\n(B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.\n(C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n(D) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.\n\nFormat your response as follows: \"The correct answer is (insert answer here)\"\n<!-- repeat_36 -->", "output": "The correct answer is (B)", "ground_truth": "B", "score": {"correct": true, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": true}]}}, {"sample_id": 636, "input": "What is the correct answer to this question: Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.\n\nChoices:\n(A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n(B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n(C) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n(D) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nFormat your response as follows: \"The correct answer is (insert answer here)\"\n<!-- repeat_36 -->", "output": "The correct answer is (C) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV", "ground_truth": "C", "score": {"correct": true, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": true}]}}, {"sample_id": 686, "input": "What is the correct answer to this question: A methanol solution of (R)-(+)-Limonene is stirred with Pd/C under a Hydrogen atmosphere.
