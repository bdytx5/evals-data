Thus, he puts the five beads on the bracelet randomly, hoping that the bracelet, when possibly rotated or flipped, spells out \"CMIMC.\" What is the probability that this happens? (Robert doesn't care whether some letters appear upside down or backwards.)\n", "output": "I need to find the probability that 5 beads randomly arranged on a circular bracelet spell \"CMIMC\" when considering rotations and flips.\n\n**Step 1: Count total arrangements**\n\nSince we have 5 beads with letters C, M, I, M, C (two C's and two M's), the total number of distinguishable linear arrangements is:\n$$\\frac{5!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{120}{4} = 30$$\n\nHowever, for circular arrangements, we need to account for rotational equivalence. For a circular arrangement of 5 beads with 2 C's and 2 M's:\n$$\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{30}{5} = 6$$\n\nBut we also need to account for reflections (flips). Using Burnside's lemma for a bracelet (necklace with flips), we consider the dihedral group $D_5$ with 10 elements (5 rotations and 5 reflections).\n\n**Step 2: Count valid arrangements**\n\nThe target word \"CMIMC\" has a specific sequence. Let me identify what arrangements on a circular bracelet with flips would match this pattern.\n\nFor a circular bracelet with flips considered equivalent, I need to:\n1. List arrangements that spell CMIMC under some rotation or flip\n2. Count how many ways to arrange our beads into these equivalent classes\n\n**Step 3: Direct counting approach**\n\nLet me think about this differently. Robert randomly places 5 beads on a bracelet. Two arrangements are considered the same if related by rotation or flip.\n\nThe total number of distinct bracelets with beads C, C, M, M, I is given by:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5!}{2! \\cdot 2!} + \\text{reflections}\\right)$$\n\nUsing the formula for bracelets: For 5 distinct positions with a multiset {C, C, M, M, I}:\n\nActually, let me use a simpler approach: count all possible arrangements as equally likely, then count favorable outcomes.\n\n**Step 4: Simplified approach**\n\nTotal ways to arrange 5 beads in 5 positions = $\\frac{5!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = 30$ (linear arrangements if we label positions 1-5)\n\nNow I need to count arrangements that, under rotation or reflection, give \"CMIMC\":\n\nThe sequence CMIMC and its rotations:\n- CMIMC\n- IMCMC\n- MCMCI\n- CMCIM\n- MICMC\n\nThe sequence CMIMC reflected is CMIMC read backwards: CMIMC \u2192 CM\u0399MC (reversed)\n- Reversed: C-M-I-M-C (it's a palindrome!)\n\nSince CMIMC is a palindrome, it reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nThe rotations of CMIMC are:\n1. CMIMC\n2. IMCMC\n3. MCMCI\n4. CMCIM\n5. MICMC\n\nAnd the reflections give us the reverse, which for each rotation:\n1. Reverse of CMIMC = CMIMC (palindrome)\n2. Reverse of IMCMC = CMCMI\n3. Reverse of MCMCI = ICMCM\n4. Reverse of CMCIM = MICMC\n5. Reverse of MICMC = CMCIM\n\nSo the distinct linear sequences equivalent to CMIMC under rotation and reflection are:\n- CMIMC, IMCMC, MCMCI, CMCIM, MICMC, CMCMI, ICMCM\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The sequences that appear in the equivalence class are:\n- 5 rotations of CMIMC: CMIMC, IMCMC, MCMCI, CMCIM, MICMC\n- These 5 plus their reflections, but the reflections might overlap\n\nSince CMIMC is a palindrome: reversed = CMIMC itself\n- IMCMC reversed = CMCMI (new)\n- MCMCI reversed = ICMCM (new)  \n- CMCIM reversed = MICMC (already in rotations)\n- MICMC reversed = CMCIM (already in rotations)\n\nSo favorable linear arrangements: {CMIMC, IMCMC, MCMCI, CMCIM, MICMC, CMCMI, ICMCM}\n\nThat's 7 distinct sequences.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate probability**\n\nThe probability is:\n$$P = \\frac{7}{30}$$\n\n### Final answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{30}}$.", "ground_truth": "\\frac{1}{6}", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 9.6548}, {"sample_id": 12, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.

Define a (simple, undirected) graph $G_{n, k}$ as follows: its vertices are all of the binary strings of length $n$, and there is an edge between two strings if and only if they differ in exactly $k$ positions. If $c_{n, k}$ denotes the number of connected components of $G_{n, k}$, compute\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^{10} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} c_{n, k}\n$$\n(For example, $G_{3,2}$ has two connected components.)", "output": "I need to find the number of connected components $c_{n,k}$ for each pair $(n,k)$ where $1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 10$, then sum them all.\n\n## Understanding the Graph Structure\n\nThe vertices are binary strings of length $n$. Two vertices are connected if they differ in exactly $k$ positions.\n\n## Key Observation: Parity\n\nLet me consider the parity of the Hamming weight (number of 1's) of each string.\n\nIf two strings differ in exactly $k$ positions, their Hamming weights differ by an amount that has the same parity as $k$:\n- If we flip $k$ positions, we change the weight by some amount depending on which positions we flip\n- More precisely: if we flip $a$ ones to zeros and $b$ zeros to ones, where $a + b = k$, the weight changes by $b - a$\n- We have $b - a = b - (k-b) = 2b - k$\n\nSo the weight changes by $2b - k$, which has the same parity as $k$.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- If $k$ is **odd**, strings in the same component must have Hamming weights differing by an odd amount\n- If $k$ is **even**, strings in the same component must have Hamming weights differing by an even amount\n\n## Case 1: $k$ is odd\n\nStrings partition by parity of Hamming weight:\n- Even parity: weight $\\in \\{0, 2, 4, \\ldots\\}$\n- Odd parity: weight $\\in \\{1, 3, 5, \\ldots\\}$\n\nThese are two separate groups, so $c_{n,k} = 2$ when $k$ is odd.\n\n## Case 2: $k$ is even\n\nAll strings have the same parity constraint. But are they connected?\n\nFor even $k$, the question becomes: is the graph connected?\n\n**Key insight:** When $k$ is even and we can reach strings of all parities via paths, we need to check connectivity more carefully.\n\nActually, for even $k$, we can only move between strings of the same parity class. So strings partition by parity of Hamming weight into two groups.\n\nBut we need to check if within each parity class, the subgraph is connected.\n\n**Lemma:** For $k$ even and $1 \\leq k < n$, the graph restricted to each parity class is connected.\n\nFor $k = n$ (even): We can only reach the complement string from any string, so each component has size 2, giving $c_{n,n} = 2^{n-1}$.\n\nFor $k$ even with $k < n$: The subgraph on each parity class is connected, so $c_{n,k} = 2$.\n\n## Special Case: $k = n$\n\nWhen $k = n$, every string connects only to its bitwise complement.

Each 2\u00d72 square contains at least one coin\n\nLet me denote the grid positions as (i,j) where i is the row and j is the column, both from 1 to 4.\n\n**Identifying the 2\u00d72 squares:**\nThere are 9 overlapping 2\u00d72 squares in a 4\u00d74 grid:\n- Top-left corners at positions (i,j) where i,j \u2208 {1,2,3}\n\n**Key constraint analysis:**\nIf no two coins are orthogonally adjacent, the valid placements form an independent set. This is similar to a checkerboard pattern, but with additional constraints from the 2\u00d72 coverage requirement.\n\n**Strategy:**\nLet me think about this systematically. Consider a checkerboard coloring where (i,j) is \"black\" if i+j is even, and \"white\" if i+j is odd.\n\nIn a standard checkerboard coloring:\n- Black squares: 8 squares\n- White squares: 8 squares\n\nNo two orthogonally adjacent squares share the same color, so placing coins only on one color automatically satisfies the adjacency constraint.\n\n**Checking 2\u00d72 coverage with checkerboard patterns:**\n\nFor any 2\u00d72 square with top-left at (i,j), it contains:\n- (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1)\n\nIf we color these: the colors alternate in a checkerboard pattern, so each 2\u00d72 square contains 2 black and 2 white squares.\n\n- If we place coins on all black squares: each 2\u00d72 has exactly 2 coins \u2713\n- If we place coins on all white squares: each 2\u00d72 has exactly 2 coins \u2713\n\n**Can we do better or have other solutions?**\n\nSince each 2\u00d72 must have at least one coin, and we have 9 such 2\u00d72 squares, we need sufficient coverage.\n\nFor a checkerboard solution, all black squares is valid (8 coins), and all white squares is valid (8 coins).\n\n**Are there other valid configurations?**\n\nLet me consider if we can deviate from full checkerboards. If we remove a coin from the all-black configuration, we remove it from some 2\u00d72 squares. We'd need to ensure those squares still have another coin, which must come from a white square - but that would violate adjacency with remaining black squares nearby.\n\nMore carefully: in the all-black configuration, we have coins at positions where i+j is even. These are:\n(1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2), (4,4)\n\nIf we remove any black coin, say (2,2), then the 2\u00d72 squares containing (2,2) are:\n- Top-left at (1,1): contains (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) - has coin at (1,1) \u2713\n- Top-left at (1,2): contains (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3) - has coin at (1,3) \u2713\n- Top-left at (2,1): contains (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2) - has coin at (3,1) \u2713\n- Top-left at (2,2): contains (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3) - has coin at (3,3) \u2713\n\nSo removing (2,2) still maintains coverage. But now (1,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3) form a pattern where some are missing. We need to check if we can add white coins without violating adjacency.\n\nActually, the adjacency constraint is very restrictive. Any configuration must form an independent set in the grid graph. The maximum independent sets are the two checkerboard colorings.\n\n**Verification that only checkerboards work:**\n\nThe 4\u00d74 grid graph is bipartite with equal-sized parts (8 vertices each). For an independent set to exist that covers all 9 2\u00d72 squares with at least one coin each, and given the high density of 2\u00d72 requirements, the independent set must be quite large.\n\nTesting: both checkerboards have 8 coins and satisfy both conditions. Any other independent set would have at most 8 coins (maximum independent set size in a 4\u00d74 grid), and likely wouldn't cover all 2\u00d72 squares.\n\nBy symmetry and structure, the answer is exactly the two checkerboard colorings.\n\n### Final answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.", "ground_truth": "256", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 10.237}, {"sample_id": 19, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.
