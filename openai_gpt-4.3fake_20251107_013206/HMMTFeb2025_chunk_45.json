Points on that segment can be parameterized by the coordinate u along the direction t = (\u2212sin \u03b1, cos \u03b1), with u ranging over an interval of length L(\u03b1,s).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 change of variables for ordered pairs.\n\nTwo independent uniformly chosen points (ordered) in the hexagon correspond to picking \u03b1, s and two parameters u1,u2 in the chord segment. The Jacobian computation (standard in this chord parametrization) gives\ndx dy = |u1 \u2212 u2| d\u03b1 ds du1 du2.\nHence the total area of ordered pairs (the measure of all ordered pairs of points) equals\nA^2 = \u222b_{\u03b1} \u222b_{s} \u222b_{u1,u2\u2208segment} |u1 \u2212 u2| du1 du2 ds d\u03b1.\nFor a segment of length L, \u222b_{0}^{L} \u222b_{0}^{L} |u1 \u2212 u2| du1 du2 = L^3/3. Thus\nA^2 = (1/3) \u222b_{\u03b1} \u222b_{s} L(\u03b1,s)^3 ds d\u03b1,\nor equivalently\n\u222b_{\u03b1} \u222b_{s} L(\u03b1,s)^3 ds d\u03b1 = 3 A^2.   (*)\n\nStep 3 \u2014 contribution of one opposite pair (top and bottom edges).\n\nFix the top and bottom horizontal edges (y = \u00b1\u221a3/2). For those lines \u2113 that meet both the top and bottom edges the normal angle \u03b1 must satisfy |\u03b1| \u2264 \u03c0/6 (mod \u03c0), and for such \u03b1 the s-values for which \u2113 meets both top and bottom form the interval of length\n\u2113_s(\u03b1) = cos \u03b1 \u2212 \u221a3 sin \u03b1  (here cos \u03b1 > 0 in the interval).\n\nFor such a line the chord endpoints are at (x_t, \u221a3/2) and (x_b, \u2212\u221a3/2), and a simple calculation shows that the chord length does not depend on s:\nL(\u03b1) = \u221a3 / cos \u03b1.\nTherefore the contribution (integral of L^3 over \u03b1,s) for this opposite pair is\nC_pair = \u222b_{\u03b1 = \u2212\u03c0/6}^{\u03c0/6} (L(\u03b1))^3 \u00b7 \u2113_s(\u03b1) d\u03b1\n= \u222b_{\u2212\u03c0/6}^{\u03c0/6} ( (\u221a3 / cos \u03b1)^3 ) (cos \u03b1 \u2212 \u221a3 sin \u03b1) d\u03b1\n= \u222b_{\u2212\u03c0/6}^{\u03c0/6} [3\u221a3 (cos \u03b1 \u2212 \u221a3 sin \u03b1)/cos^3 \u03b1] d\u03b1.\n\nCompute this integral:\nwrite (cos \u2212 \u221a3 sin)/cos^3 = sec^2 \u03b1 \u2212 \u221a3 (sin / cos^3) = sec^2 \u03b1 \u2212 \u221a3 tan \u03b1 sec^2 \u03b1.\nSo\nC_pair = \u222b_{\u2212\u03c0/6}^{\u03c0/6} [3\u221a3 sec^2 \u03b1 \u2212 9 tan \u03b1 sec^2 \u03b1] d\u03b1\n= [3\u221a3 tan \u03b1 \u2212 (9/2) sec^2 \u03b1]_{\u2212\u03c0/6}^{\u03c0/6} = 6.\n(One may check the arithmetic of the elementary antiderivatives.)\n\nSo the three opposite pairs together contribute\nC_opposite_total = 3 \u00b7 C_pair = 18\nto the integral \u222b\u222b L^3 ds d\u03b1.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 probability.\n\nFrom (*) we have \u222b\u222b L^3 ds d\u03b1 = 3 A^2. Compute A^2 = (3\u221a3/2)^2 = 27/4, so 3 A^2 = 81/4 = 20.25.\n\nThe measure (in the \u222b L^3 sense) of all lines producing an opposite-pair chord is 18, so the fraction of the total \u222b L^3 accounted for by opposite-pair chords is 18 / (81/4) = 72/81 = 8/9.\n\nTranslating back to the probability for two independent uniformly chosen points (ordered or unordered \u2014 the line does not depend on ordering) we get the same ratio:\n\nProbability = 8/9.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\\tfrac{8}{9}}", "ground_truth": "\\frac{4}{9}", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}}, {"sample_id": 1022, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nThe circumference of a circle is divided into $45$ arcs, each of length $1$. Initially, there are $15$ snakes, each of length $1$, occupying every third arc. Every second, each snake independently moves either one arc left or one arc right, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. If two snakes ever touch, they merge to form a single snake occupying the arcs of both of the previous snakes, and the merged snake moves as one snake. Compute the expected number of seconds until there is only one snake left.\n<!-- repeat_22 -->", "output": "Step 1 \u2014 reformulate in continuous time.  \nIt is convenient to work in continuous time: let each snake carry an independent rate-1 Poisson clock and when its clock rings it jumps one arc left or right (each with probability 1/2). Because the discrete synchronous model in the problem has each snake making one \u00b11 move per second in lockstep, the continuous-time model with rate-1 jumps has the same one-step transition probabilities and only differs by randomizing the global clock; in particular the expected time until full coalescence in the continuous-time chain equals the expected time in the discrete-time chain (the two processes are time changes of each other with mean 1 step per unit time). We therefore work with the continuous-time version.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 use rotation symmetry to get the pairwise coalescence rate.  \nAt any time, because the initial configuration is invariant under rotation by 3 arcs and the dynamics is rotation-invariant, the law of the configuration is rotation-invariant. Hence at any time, for any unordered pair of distinct snakes A,B, the chance that A and B are at the same arc (i.e. occupy the same site) is 1/45. When A and B occupy the same site they instantaneously have coalesced; in continuous time a coalescence of that unordered pair can only happen at an instant when one of the two snakes jumps and lands on the other, or vice versa, but the net instantaneous rate at which that unordered pair coalesces equals 1/45. (Intuitively: because of rotation-invariance the two-particle relative position is uniform on 45 sites, so the instantaneous rate of hitting 0 relative displacement is 1/45.)\n\nThus when there are k snakes present, there are C(k,2)=k(k\u22121)/2 unordered pairs, and by symmetry each pair coalesces at rate 1/45, so the total instantaneous rate at which the number of snakes decreases from k to k\u22121 is\nR_k = C(k,2) \u00b7 (1/45) = k(k\u22121)/(2\u00b745) = k(k\u22121)/90.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 compute expected time to go from k snakes to k\u22121 snakes.  \nIf the total coalescence rate is R_k, the waiting time until the next coalescence (when there are k snakes) is exponential with mean 1/R_k = 90/(k(k\u22121)).\n\nStep 4 \u2014 sum the expected waiting times.  \nStarting with k = 15 snakes, the expected total time until only one snake remains is the sum of the mean waiting times over successive reductions of the number of snakes:\nE[T] = sum_{k=2}^{15} 90/(k(k\u22121))\n= 90 \u00b7 sum_{k=2}^{15} (1/(k\u22121) \u2212 1/k)\n= 90 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 1/15)\n= 90 \u00b7 (14/15)\n= 84.\n\nTherefore the expected number of seconds until there is only one snake left is 84.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{84}", "ground_truth": "\\frac{448}{3}", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}}]
