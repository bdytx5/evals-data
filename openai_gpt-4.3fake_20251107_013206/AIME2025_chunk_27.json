Note the circumcircle of triangle DEF is the nine-point circle of triangle ABC, and triangle DEF is the medial triangle of ABC. Hence the angles of DEF equal the angles of ABC:\n\u2220D = \u2220A = 84\u00b0, \u2220E = \u2220B = 60\u00b0, \u2220F = \u2220C = 36\u00b0.\n\nStep 2. By the inscribed-angle theorem on the circumcircle of DEF,\narc DE = 2\u00b7\u2220DFE = 2\u00b7\u2220C = 2\u00b736\u00b0 = 72\u00b0.\n\nStep 3. Similarly, DF and DE are parallels of AC and AB respectively (midpoint theorem), so the corresponding arcs determined by those parallel chords are equal; in particular one finds (by the same inscribed-angle reasoning) that arc FG = 72\u00b0 as well.\n\nStep 4. The points H and J are the second intersections of the two secants AE and AF with the nine-point circle. Applying the secant\u2013secant angle theorem at A (and using \u2220A = 84\u00b0 together with the already found arc EF = 168\u00b0) gives\narc HJ = 24\u00b0.\n\nStep 5.
