[{"sample_id": 11, "input": "What is the correct answer to this question: All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2011CoV\u20112) are correct except\n\nChoices:\n(A) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n(B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.\n(C) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.\n(D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.\n\nFormat your response as follows: \"The correct answer is (insert answer here)\"", "output": "Let me analyze each statement about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology:\n\n**(A) ORF3a and apoptosis pathway:**\nThis statement is correct. ORF3a has been shown to trigger caspase-8 activation (extrinsic pathway) without affecting Bcl-2 (which is involved in intrinsic/mitochondrial pathway). This is well-documented in the literature.\n\n**(B) nsp10/nsp14-ExoN heterodimer:**\nThis statement is correct. nsp14 contains an exonuclease (ExoN) domain that forms a complex with nsp10. This heterodimer functions in proofreading during viral RNA synthesis, preventing mutations by degrading mismatched nucleotides.\n\n**(C) Frameshifting and pseudoknot conformations:**\nThis statement contains an issue. While it's true that SARS-CoV-2 has programmed -1 frameshifting signals and pseudoknots, the statement claims that \"both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations.\" The key issue is that the correlation between frameshifting rates and the number of pseudoknot conformations is not strictly linear, and the specific structural details about conformations may not be accurately described here.\n\n**(D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting:**\nThis statement is correct. SARS-CoV-2 uses programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting involving slippery sites and pseudoknots to generate polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) from the 5' end of the genome.\n\nThe most problematic statement is **(C)** because it makes specific claims about linear correlation and conformational similarity that oversimplify or misrepresent the actual molecular mechanisms.\n\n**The correct answer is (C)**", "ground_truth": "B", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 5.1883}, {"sample_id": 12, "input": "What is the correct answer to this question: Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.\n\nChoices:\n(A) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n(B) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n(C) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n(D) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nFormat your response as follows: \"The correct answer is (insert answer here)\"", "output": "I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino produced when a stationary pion decays.\n\n**Given:**\n- Initial: \u03c0\u207a at rest with mass M = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2\n- Final: \u03bc\u207a with mass m\u2081 = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2\n- Final: \u03bd with mass m\u2082 \u2248 0 (neutrino mass negligible)\n\n**Conservation of momentum:**\nSince the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\nTherefore: p_\u03bc + p_\u03bd = 0, which means |p_\u03bc| = |p_\u03bd| = p\n\n**Conservation of energy:**\nMc\u00b2 = E_\u03bc + E_\u03bd\n\nWhere:\n- E_\u03bc = \u221a(p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u2081\u00b2c\u2074)\n- E_\u03bd = pc (for massless neutrino)\n\nSubstituting:\n139.6 = \u221a(p\u00b2c\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + pc\n\nLet pc = x:\n139.6 = \u221a(x\u00b2 + 11,172.49) + x\n\n139.6 - x = \u221a(x\u00b2 + 11,172.49)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n(139.6 - x)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 11,172.49\n19,488.16 - 279.2x + x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 11,172.49\n19,488.16 - 279.2x = 11,172.49\n279.2x = 8,315.67\nx = 29.78 MeV\n\nSo: pc = 29.78 MeV\n\n**Kinetic energies:**\n\nFor neutrino:\nKE_\u03bd = E_\u03bd = pc = **29.78 \u2248 29.8 MeV**\n\nFor muon:\nE_\u03bc = \u221a(29.78\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) = \u221a(887.06 + 11,172.49) = \u221a12,059.55 = 109.81 MeV\nKE_\u03bc = E_\u03bc - m\u2081c\u00b2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = **4.11 \u2248 4.12 MeV**\n\nThe correct answer is **(B) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**", "ground_truth": "B", "score": {"correct": true, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": true}]}, "latency_seconds": 4.6978}, {"sample_id": 14, "input": "What is the correct answer to this question: ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used.

For the nucleon to behave as \"free,\" it must be treated as if it's not bound in the nucleus, i.e., no binding forces act on it during the interaction.\n\nThe impulse approximation is fundamentally about:\n- The probe interacting with one nucleon (1)\n- That nucleon being isolated from the rest of the nucleus (2)\n- The nucleon acting freely, unbound (4)\n\nAssumption 3 about quarks being non-relativistic is a separate consideration about nucleon internal structure rather than about the nucleus-nucleon dynamics required for the impulse approximation.\n\nThe correct answer is **(B) 1,2,4**", "ground_truth": "B", "score": {"correct": true, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": true}]}, "latency_seconds": 4.1723}, {"sample_id": 21, "input": "What is the correct answer to this question: Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).\n\nChoices:\n(A) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n(B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n(C) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n(D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nFormat your response as follows: \"The correct answer is (insert answer here)\"", "output": "Let me analyze each part of this question:\n\n**Part A: Which compound does NOT show tautomerism?**\n\n1. **Benzoquinone**: This is a stable, aromatic compound with alternating C=O and C=C bonds in a ring. It does NOT readily undergo tautomerism because the aromatic system is stable.\n\n2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on alternating carbons. It CAN show keto-enol tautomerism because ketone groups are prone to tautomerization (the hydrogen can shift between keto and enol forms).\n\nTherefore, **benzoquinone does NOT show tautomerism**.\n\n**Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?**\n\n1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This has the structure CH\u2083-CH(OH)-COOCH\u2083. The carbon bearing the OH group is a chiral center (it has four different groups attached), so this compound WILL show optical isomerism.\n\n2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is a symmetrical molecule with the structure (COOCH\u2083)HC=CH(COOCH\u2083) in trans configuration. Due to its symmetry, it does NOT have a chiral center and does NOT show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- A = benzoquinone\n- B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct answer is **(C)**", "ground_truth": "C", "score": {"correct": true, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": true}]}, "latency_seconds": 3.8186}]
