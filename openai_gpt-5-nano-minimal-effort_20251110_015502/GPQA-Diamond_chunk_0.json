A state with lifetime \u03c4 has an energy uncertainty \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c4) (order of magnitude ~ \u0127/\u03c4). To clearly resolve two levels with lifetimes \u03c41 = 10^-9 s and \u03c42 = 10^-8 s, their energy difference \u0394E must be larger than the typical linewidths set by these lifetimes. Using \u0394E ~ \u0127/\u03c4, the smaller lifetime (10^-9 s) gives a linewidth ~ \u0127/(10^-9 s) \u2248 6.6\u00d710^-25 J \u2248 4\u00d710^-6 eV, and for 10^-8 s gives ~6.6\u00d710^-26 J \u2248 4\u00d710^-7 eV. To clearly distinguish the levels, the energy difference should be of the order of, or larger than, these values; among the options, 10^-8 eV is comfortably larger than the linewidths and would allow clear resolution. The other options are much smaller (10^-9, 10^-11, 10^-4 eV would be borderline or too large for practical distinction given the lifetimes, but the standard criterion points to the scale around 10^-8 eV).
