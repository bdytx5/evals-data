Each vertex has degree 3, so A j = 3 j (j the all-1 vector), and for distinct vertices i \u2260 j the (i,j)-entry of A^2 equals the number of common neighbors of i and j. The hypothesis says each off-diagonal entry of A^2 is either 0 or 2, so (A^2)ij \u2208 {0,2} for i \u2260 j, while (A^2)ii = deg(i) = 3.\n\nSum of row i of A^2 equals (A^2 j)i = 9, so the sum of the off-diagonal entries in row i is 9 \u2212 3 = 6. Since each off-diagonal entry is 0 or 2, exactly three off-diagonal entries in each row equal 2. Define a 0\u20131 matrix B by Bij = 1 if i \u2260 j and (A^2)ij = 2, and Bij = 0 otherwise.

Because B is 3-regular, \u03bc = 3 is an eigenvalue of B (with multiplicity equal to the number of connected components of B), so for the eigenvalues \u03bbk that correspond to \u03bc = 3 we must have \u03bbk^2 = 9, hence \u03bbk \u2208 {3,\u22123}. Also any \u03bbk with \u03bbk^2 = 1 gives \u03bc = (1 \u2212 3)/2 = \u22121.\n\nThus every eigenvalue of A must lie in {3, \u22123, 1, \u22121}.

For a 3-regular graph this forces each component to be a K4 (each vertex must have the other three vertices of its component as neighbors). With 8 vertices the only possibility is two disjoint K4\u2019s. This gives one isomorphism class, the graph 2K4.\n\nCase II: A \u2260 B.

At each lattice vertex v we will try to assign a bit x_v \u2208 {0,1} which will stand for the color of every triangle whose right angle is at v (whenever such a triangle exists). Notice that in any unit square the two triangular pieces have their right angles at the two opposite corners of the square, so the single diagonal choice in that square forces those two opposite corners to have opposite bits. Thus each square gives one linear equation over GF(2) of the form x_i + x_j = 1 where i and j are the two opposite corners that are the right-angle vertices of the two triangles in that square.\n\n2) Conversely, if one can find an assignment of bits x_v on all 25 lattice points that satisfies the 16 equations coming from the 16 unit squares, then that assignment gives a valid red/blue coloring of all triangles: color each triangle by the bit of its right-angle vertex. Every adjacency constraint (either along a square side or along a diagonal in a square) is then satisfied, because the equations ensure the two opposite right-angle vertices in each square are different, and that forces neighboring triangles that share an edge to have opposite bits.\n\n3) So the question reduces to: for a randomly chosen pattern of diagonals (equivalently a random right-hand\u2013side vector of 16 ones corresponding to the 16 equations), what is the probability that the 16 linear equations in the 25 unknowns x_v are consistent?

For i = 0,\u2026,9 put c_i for the carry into position i when computing 2B (so c_0 = 0 and c_{10} = 0). For each i we then have\n   2 b_i + c_i = a_i + 10 c_{i+1},   with each c_i \u2208 {0,1}.\n\n2) Sum these ten equalities over i. The left side sums to 2\u00b745 + \u03a3 c_i = 90 + \u03a3 c_i; the right side sums to 45 + 10 \u03a3 c_{i+1} = 45 + 10 \u03a3 c_i (because c_{10}=c_0=0). Hence\n   90 + \u03a3 c_i = 45 + 10 \u03a3 c_i \u21d2 45 = 9 \u03a3 c_i \u21d2 \u03a3 c_i = 5.\nSo exactly five of the carries c_1,\u2026,c_9 (and c_0 = c_{10} = 0) equal 1.\n\n3) For a given digit b_i there are only two possibilities for b_i: either b_i \u2208 {0,1,2,3,4} (call it \u201csmall\u201d) or b_i \u2208 {5,6,7,8,9} (call it \u201cbig\u201d). A straightforward case check from 2 b_i + c_i = a_i + 10 c_{i+1} shows that\n   c_{i+1} = 1 \u21d4 b_i is big,\nindependently of c_i. In words: there is a carry out of position i iff the digit in position i is one of 5,6,7,8,9. Thus exactly the five big digits produce the five carries; equivalently, each big digit is followed (to the next more-significant position) by a carry-in of 1, and each small digit is followed by carry-in 0. In particular c_{10} = 0 forces b9 to be small, so the most significant digit of B is in {1,2,3,4} (it cannot be 0).\n\n4) Now examine how digits map under the doubling at a single position. If c_i = 0 then\n   a_i = 2 b_i        (if b_i \u2264 4)  or  a_i = 2 b_i \u2212 10 (if b_i \u2265 5),\nand if c_i = 1 then\n   a_i = 2 b_i + 1    (if b_i \u2264 4)  or  a_i = 2 b_i \u2212 9  (if b_i \u2265 5).\nHence for each v = 0,1,2,3,4 the two digits v and v+5 are always sent (by these local formulas) to the same pair of values {2v, 2v+1} \u2013 but whether v maps to 2v or 2v+1 depends precisely on whether the carry into v\u2019s position (i.e. whether the predecessor digit is big). Concretely, if both v and v+5 had the same carry-in c at their positions then they would both map to the same a-digit and A would have a repeated digit. Therefore for each pair (v, v+5) the two occurrences of those two digits in B must have different carry-in bits. Equivalently:\n   For each pair {v, v+5} (v = 0,\u2026,4), exactly one of the two positions that contain v and v+5 must have carry-in 1 (its predecessor must be big) and the other must have carry-in 0 (its predecessor must be small).\n\nBut we already know there are exactly five carry-in positions equal to 1, and there are five pairs. So for each pair exactly one carry-in = 1 must occur. This is a necessary condition coming from injectivity of the mapping B\u2192A.\n\n5) Think of B\u2019s digits arranged in order around the circle of positions (with wrap-around predecessor of position 0 being b9). Each digit is predecessor of exactly one digit. The condition from (4) says: for each pair {v,v+5}, the two digits v and v+5 must be preceded (in the circle) by digits of opposite category (one preceded by a big digit, the other by a small digit). Thus among the ten predecessor\u2192current directed edges around the circle, the five big digits must point to exactly one member of each pair and the five small digits must point to the other member of each pair.\n\n6) Now comes the impossibility. The predecessor relation is a single 10-cycle (the 10 positions in B form a single cyclic order), so the directed edges (each digit \u2192 its successor position) form exactly one directed cycle of length 10. In any directed cycle, the number of edges that go from a big digit to a small digit equals the number of edges that go from a small digit to a big digit (because along the cycle every time you go from big to small you must later go from small to big to return, so these counts are equal). But the condition in step (5) forces, for each of the five pairs, that exactly one of the two members is pointed to by a big-digit predecessor and the other by a small-digit predecessor; summing over the five pairs this implies that the number of big\u2192small edges and the number of small\u2192big edges are different parity (in fact, they would have to differ), which contradicts the cycle property that they must be equal. (Hence no such single 10-cycle arrangement exists.)\n\n7) Therefore no permutation B of the digits 0,\u2026,9 can satisfy all requirements: there is no 10-digit pandigital B for which A=2B is also a 10-digit pandigital. Consequently there are no peacocks that are exactly twice another peacock.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{0}", "ground_truth": "184320", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}}]
