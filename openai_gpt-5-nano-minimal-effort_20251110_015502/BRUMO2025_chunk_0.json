That means: Cn is the incircle of an equilateral triangle whose circumscribed circle is Cn+1.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle, if its circumradius is R and inradius is r, then r = R/2. (Since for an equilateral triangle, side s satisfies R = s/\u221a3 and r = s/(2\u221a3), hence r = R/2.)\n\nHere the circumcircle of the triangle is Cn+1 with radius R_{n+1}, and the incircle of the triangle is Cn with radius r_n. Thus r_n = R_{n+1}/2.\n\nBut R_{n+1} is simply the radius of C_{n+1}. So r_n = (radius of C_{n+1})/2, i.e. R_n = r_n? Careful with notation: Let a_n be the radius of C_n. Then the relation from Cn inscribed in triangle with circumradius a_{n+1} gives a_n = a_{n+1}/2.\n\nThus a_{n+1} = 2 a_n.

So along the permutation, adjacent elements must come from different residue classes.\n\nWe need to count sequences of length 6 using two elements from each class, with no two consecutive from the same class.\n\nThis is equivalent to counting sequences of residues of length 6 using exactly two 0s, two 1s, two 2s, with no two identical residues adjacent, and then multiply by the internal permutations within each residue class (since within a residue class we can arrange the two specific numbers in 2! ways for each class).\n\nStep 1: Count residue sequences\nWe count sequences of letters A,B,C (representing residues 0,1,2) with exactly two of each letter and no two identical adjacent.\n\nLet\u2019s count using inclusion-exclusion or constructive enumeration. First count all sequences with two of each: number of permutations of multiset {A,A,B,B,C,C} is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 720/8 = 90.\n\nSubtract those with at least one adjacent equal pair. Let E_A be event that there is AA adjacent somewhere; similarly E_B, E_C.\n\nWe compute using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTreat AA as a single symbol X, so we have symbols X, B,B,C,C (with two Bs and two Cs). Count permutations of 5 objects with multiplicities: 5!/(2!2!) = 30. But note within AA the two As are identical in residues, so there is exactly 1 way for the pair. Similarly for other pairs. So |E_A| = |E_B| = |E_C| = 30.\n\nNow intersections: E_A \u2229 E_B means AA adjacent and BB adjacent. Treat AA as X and BB as Y, plus C,C: objects X,Y,C,C: 4 objects with multiplicity 2 for C. Count = 4!/(2!) = 12.

In a complete t-partite graph with group sizes s1, s2, ..., st, the degree of a vertex in group i is n \u2212 s_i (since it is connected to all vertices outside its own group). We are given this degree equals 12 for every vertex, so n \u2212 s_i = 12 for all i. Therefore all s_i are equal, and n = t * s with s = n \u2212 12.\n\nThus s = n \u2212 12 and also s = n/t, so n/t = n \u2212 12, yielding n(1/t \u2212 1) = \u221212, i.e. n( (1 \u2212 t)/t ) = \u221212, or n = 12 t / (t \u2212 1).\n\nWe need n an integer, with t \u2265 2. Compute possible t:\n\n- t = 2: n = 12*2/1 = 24.\n- t = 3: n = 12*3/2 = 18.\n- t = 4: n = 12*4/3 = 16.\n- t = 5: n = 12*5/4 = 15.\n- t = 6: n = 12*6/5 = 72/5 not integer.\n- t = 7: n = 84/6 = 14.\n- t = 8: n = 96/7 not integer.\n- t = 12: n = 144/11 not integer.\nContinuing, only t giving integer n are t in {2,3,4,5,7}. For these, n \u2208 {24,18,16,15,14}.\n\nWe must also ensure Bruno is not a guest, but Bruno is outside this graph, so the party size n is as above.\n\nSum of all possible n values: 24 + 18 + 16 + 15 + 14 = 87.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{87}", "ground_truth": "100", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 0.0109}]
