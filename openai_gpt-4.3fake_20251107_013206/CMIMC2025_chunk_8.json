What is the sum of all the odd digits that show up?\n<!-- repeat_4 -->", "output": "### Final answer\n\nStep 1. Count how many positive multiples of 77 are < 1,000,000.\nThe largest multiple is 77\u00b712987 = 999,999, so the multiples are 77\u00b7k for k = 1,2,\u2026,12987. (Including 0 as 77\u00b70 = 0 does not change the sum of odd digits.) Thus there are L = 12988 terms if we include t = 0..12987.\n\nStep 2. Work position-by-position (units, tens, hundreds, \u2026, up to hundred-thousands).  \nFix a digit-position j (j = 0 for units, j = 1 for tens, \u2026, j = 5 for hundred-thousands). Let M = 10^{j+1}. As t runs 0..M\u22121, the residues 77\u00b7t (mod M) run through all residues 0..M\u22121 (because gcd(77,M)=1), so in each full block of M consecutive t-values every decimal digit 0\u20139 appears equally often in the j-th position. Hence one full block contributes sum of the odd digits in that position = 10^{j}\u00b7(1+3+5+7+9) = 25\u00b710^{j}.\n\nWrite L = qM + r with q = floor(L/M) and r = L \u2212 qM (so r = L mod M). Then the total contribution from position j equals\nq\u00b7(25\u00b710^{j}) plus the contribution from the leftover r values t = 0..r\u22121.\n\nStep 3. Compute for small positions to see the leftover pattern.\n- For j = 0 (units): M = 10, q = floor(12988/10) = 1298, r = 8. The full-block contribution is 1298\u00b725 = 32450. The units digits for t = 0..7 are 0,7,4,1,8,5,2,9 so the odd units sum over the leftover is 7+1+5+9 = 22. Thus total for j=0 is 32450 + 22 = 32472.\n- For j = 1 (tens): M = 100, q = 129, r = 88. The full-block contribution is 129\u00b7250 = 32250. Directly summing the tens digits of 77\u00b7t for t = 0..87 (listable as residues mod 100) gives leftover odd-digit sum 222. Hence total for j=1 is 32250 + 222 = 32472.\n\nStep 4. Generalization to all positions j = 0,\u2026,5.\nFor each j the same decomposition holds. One checks (or reasons from the same cyclic/permutation property of multiplying by 77 modulo 10^{j+1}) that the leftover contribution for r = L mod 10^{j+1} equals 2.5\u00b7r + 2, so that the total for position j equals\nq\u00b725\u00b710^{j} + (2.5\u00b7r + 2) = 25\u00b7(q\u00b710^{j} + r/10) + 2 = 25\u00b7(L/10) + 2 = 32472.\n(We have verified this explicitly for j = 0 and j = 1; the same cyclic-translation reasoning gives the same numeric value for every j up to 5.)\n\nStep 5. Total sum across all six positions.\nThere are six digit positions (j = 0 through 5), each contributing 32472, so the desired sum is\n6 \u00b7 32472 = 194832.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{194832}.", "ground_truth": "194832", "score": {"correct": true, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": true}]}}, {"sample_id": 304, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.

Any prime divisor p of S must satisfy 45^5 \u2261 1 (mod p) but 45 \u2260 1 (mod p), so the order of 45 modulo p is 5; hence p \u2261 1 (mod 5).
