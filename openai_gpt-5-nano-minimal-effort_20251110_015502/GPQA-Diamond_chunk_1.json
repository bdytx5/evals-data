They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2.

Given Planet_1 has period P1 and Planet_2 has P2 = 3 P1, the ratio a2/a1 = (P2/P1)^(2/3) \u00d7 (M_star1/M_star2)^(1/3).
