Specifically, my strategy is to cut out a net. If I cut out a parallelogram-shaped net that yields the biggest regular tetrahedron, what is the surface area of the resulting tetrahedron?\n", "output": "To form a regular tetrahedron from a net cut from a 7 by 7 square, the net must be a set of four equilateral triangles joined edge-to-edge. The edge of the tetrahedron equals the side length s of those equilateral triangles.\n\nIn a square net, the maximum possible s is constrained by fitting four equilateral triangles into a parallelogram-shaped net inside the square. A common optimal arrangement uses a rhombus (parallelogram) with acute angle 60\u00b0, formed by two equilateral triangles sharing a side, extended to include four triangles total in the net.\n\nFor a rhombus built from equilateral triangles of side s, the height (distance between the two opposite sides) in the direction perpendicular to a pair of opposite edges equals s\u221a3/2 for each triangle, and the overall bounding square side must accommodate the projection of the net. The maximal s that fits in a 7\u00d77 square for such a parallelogram net is s = 14/3.\n\nThus the edge length of the resulting regular tetrahedron is s = 14/3, and the surface area of a regular tetrahedron with edge length s is 4 times the area of an equilateral triangle of side s:\nArea = 4 \u00d7 (\u221a3/4) s^2 = \u221a3 \u00b7 s^2.\n\nCompute:\ns^2 = (14/3)^2 = 196/9\nArea = \u221a3 \u00d7 196/9 = 196\u221a3 / 9.\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the resulting tetrahedron is 196\u221a3 / 9.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{196\\sqrt{3}/9}", "ground_truth": "14\\sqrt{3}", "score": {"correct": false, "mode": "majority", "votes": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "correct": false}]}, "latency_seconds": 0.0124}, {"sample_id": 22, "input": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.
